Implementation
==============

[[Parent]]: somsds.txt

These section describes the implementation of the SOMSDS module.
The information here is not needed to use the SOMSDS scripts.
Before reading this document, you should read everything from 
the [user documentation][UserDocumentation].

The actual implementation can be found under [Core stuff][corestuff]. The 
SOMSDS scripts sometimes rely on .ini configuration to specify user parameters.
There are three types of files that a user might need to provide:

* __Recording settings files__. These are required by utility script 
`somsds_new_rec`. These files specify the modalities, conditions, subjects, etc
of a given recording.

* __Name translation files__. These are required by utility script 
`somsds_describe` in order to decode tag information (modality, condition, 
subject, etc.) from the file names of your experimental data files.

* __Link configuration files__. These files can be used in combination with 
script `somsds_link2rec` in order to produce symbolic links that use non-default
naming conventions.
