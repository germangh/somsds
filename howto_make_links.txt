Step 4: Generate symbolic links
============

[[Parent]]: howto_recordings.txt

After checking that the description files generated in the [previous step][prev]
 look OK we are ready to generate the symbolic links using the command:

	somsds_update_rec bcgs

[prev]: ./howto_file_descriptions.htm

You can run the command above yourself to see the [output][update_rec_output]
 that it produces. You should pay attention for warnings that may indicate that
 something went wrong during the generation of the [tag descriptor][prev] files. 

[update_rec_output]: ./somsds_update_rec_output.txt

## What now?

Congratulations! Your data is now properly organized. All the important files, 
that you are likely to use in your analyses are now easily available from 
the `raw` directories, as discussed in [The SOMSDS data structure][somsds]. You
can now [start analyzing your data][projects].
