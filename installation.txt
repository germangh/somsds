Installing at the somerenserver
--------

The SOMSDS scripts can be easily installed by uncompressing all the files into
a folder and running:

	./somsds_install.pl

The command above requires administrator privileges as it places symbolic 
links in few system directories. To uninstall SOMSDS run:

	./somsds_uninstall.pl
	
	

Installing at your local machine
--------

It is sometimes very convenient to perform analysis on your local machine
rather than at the server. You can still use the advantages of the 
somerenserver data structure by:

* Mounting the somerenserver file system in your local machine
* Installing the SOMSDS scripts at your local machine

As the SOMSDS scripts rely heavily on symbolic links, they can be used 
only under operating systems that support symbolic links, e.g. Max OS 
and Linux. It is also possible to use the scripts in Windows using
[Cygwin][cygwin]. 

[cygwin]: http://www.cygwin.com/

Installation on a machine other than `somerenserver` requires editting
the configuration file [SOMSDS.ini][somsds-ini] so that the properties
`root_path` and `arc_folder` under group `somsds` contain the correct locations
for your system. For instance, under Windows-Cygwin, you may have mounted 
the somerenserver `data1` file system as a network drive identified by the
volume `Y:`. In such a case, your [SOMSDS.ini][somsds-ini] file should look 
like this:

[somsds-ini]: ./SOMSDS/lib/SOMSDS.ini.htm

	[somsds]
	root_path      =/cygdrive/y/data1
	arc_folder     =/cygdrive/y/archive

You will also need to modify the properties `spm8` and `fast` under group
`dependencies` so that they match the locations of the [SPM8][spm] and 
[FAST][fast] toolboxes on your system. Under a Windows system you may 
end up with something like this:

[spm]: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/
[fast]: http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~phillips/FASST.html

	[dependencies]
	fast         =D:/mlib/FAST
	spm8         =D:/mlib/spm8
	
Once done the modifications above you can easy install/uninstall the 
scripts using:

	./somsds_install.pl
	./somsds_uninstall.pl
