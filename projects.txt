Projects
============

[[Parent]]: ds.txt

Each __project__ is uniquely identified by its project ID (`$PROJID`). The only
requirement for a project ID is to be a valid directory name. It is recommended
to use short project names. If a project is going to analyse data coming from
a single recording you might as well use the corresponding recording ID as your
project ID. 

A project with project ID `$PROJID` typically contains the following standard
folders:

	/data/projects/$PROJID/analysis
	/data/projects/$PROJID/doc
	/data/projects/$PROJID/recordings
	/data/projects/$PROJID/results
	/data/projects/$PROJID/scripts
	/data/projects/$PROJID/tmp


where `/data/projects` is the standard location for all projects. Note that 
this might change in the future.

### The doc folder

The `doc` folder should contain one or more documents explaining (at least) 
the purpose of the project, the people involved and the type of analyses 
performed. 


### The recordings and analysis folders

The `recordings` folder is to be used as a container of symbolic links to the
raw data files used in the project. More information regarding the generation 
of these links can be found in the [projects methodology][methodology_projects]
 section. Single-level, straightforward analyses (e.g. the results of a 
Freesurfer analysis) may be stored in this folder. However, group-level analyses
and more elaborate analyses should be stored in the `analysis` folder.

### The scripts folder

The `scripts` folder should contain all the scripts that you used to perform
the analysis. Once the project is finnished and before archiving it, you must 
also place in this folder all the external dependencies that your scripts
require. For instance, if your analysis uses Fieldtrip you should store in this
folder a copy of the `Fieldtrip` version that you used. Otherwise, you might 
not be able to reproduce your analysis in the future, due to development
changes in the dependent libraries. 

### The results folder

The `results` folder contains all the public outcomes of the project. Do not 
store in this folder intermediate results but only things that you think can
be made available to people outside our research group. Examples of such 
final results are articles, posters, presentations and (well documented) software
packages. 


### The tmp folder
The `tmp` folder should contain only temporal data, i.e. data that is not 
required to reproduce perfectly your analysis (using the software in `scripts` 
and the data files in `recordings`). This folder will be emptied before a 
project is archived so be careful not to store here anything important.
