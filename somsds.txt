SOMSDS
===

_SOMSDS_ is a package of Perl scripts for easy organization within a research
group of recording-related data (e.g. raw EEG or fMRI measurements) and 
projects-related data, i.e. analyses performed on one or more recordings.
In particular, the scripts implement the standard data structure used at the 
[Sleep & Cognition][scpage] group of the 
[Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience][ninpage] (NIN).


Features of the package
--------

* Generation of standard directory trees

* Import directory trees that do not follow the SOMSDS conventions

* Consistency checks that will detect most common errors when documenting
data files

* SQL interface for retrieving relevant data files

* Easy archiving/archiving of experimental data
